              <li>Doan Huy</li>
              <p>
                My name is Doan Huy, my student number is s3924345. I’m
                Vietnamese, 18 years old and I’m in the 1st semester at RMIT. I
                have a number of hobbies and I believe my hobbies would help me
                a lot in my life, such as listening to music, playing musical
                instruments help me to connect with people who have interest in
                music, playing sports such as football, basketball help me to
                stay healthy, expand my network by playing with different people
                as a team. Otherwise, esports is another hobby to help me
                entertain, connect with more friends and strengthen our
                relationship based on teamwork and collaborative games, such as
                League of Legends, PUBG, Call of duty,... which attracts
                millions of players around the world. When it comes to my IT
                interest, I am interested in different IT projects, but what I
                like most about IT are the Internet of things (IoT) and AI . I
                have been interested in IOT and AI since I was a child, by
                watching science fiction movies, where characters control
                different devices such as lights, cars by voice, gestures,...
                and smart robots that support humanity in different aspects.
                When I grew up, I have seen different realistic applications of
                IOT and AI in real life, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home and
                Google assistant, Tesla self-driving car… Moreover, IoT demand
                is growing rapidly, when different companies invest in IoT and
                AI in their products like Google, Bosch+, LG, Samsung and other
                tech companies invest and develop their products for IoT
                compatibility. As a result, I believe that in the future, I will
                have a high opportunity to develop my career path as an IoT
                developer, earn a fortune by doing what I love in this field.
                Regarding IT experiences, I’m a freshman in IT, so I have not
                had any experience in IT, so I will make an effort, work hard
                and always be willing to learn to improve my knowledge and
                skills that are required in this industry. I hope in the future,
                I will catch up with the innovation of IoT and become successful
                in this field.

              <li>Tran Anh Son</li>
              <p>
                My name is Tran Anh Son and my RMIT Student ID is s3926557. I
                was born and raised in the capital city of Vietnam – the city of
                Hanoi. Right now, I am living with 4 other members of my family
                (my parents and two sisters) in the city suburbs. After 12 years
                of education in schools as a good student, I have learnt a lot
                about Math and natural sciences in general as they are my
                favorite subjects. Furthermore, I am also a very good English
                learner as I have achieved an IELTS Certificate of 7.0 recently
                and other smaller prizes for excellent students of the city for
                English. My friends often say that I am smart and perceptive,
                but I just think they overestimate me because I am just eager to
                learn new things, no matter what the topics. Like many other
                young Vietnamese, I like playing sports, especially football,
                and listening to music. Apart from that, I also play online
                video games when I have spare time and truth be told, I am
                pretty good at these games. However, my real passion is for
                information technology and computers. I remember when I was just
                a small child, my uncle used to have an Internet café and he
                taught me so many things about computers and technology. That is
                when I realized how much I love computer parts and the programs
                that are running inside them. Since then, I have always had a
                dream of being a video game developer working for a big
                technology corporation. Lastly, I am the kind of person who
                wants everything I do to be the best, so I always push myself
                harder and harder in order to achieve that preference.

              <li>Tran Duy Hung</li>
              <p>
                I’m Tran Duy Hung, s3928533 is my student number. I come from
                Vietnam and now I’m a freshman at RMIT University. I have a huge
                passion for music, especially Rap & Hiphop. Since I was small, I
                have always wondered whenever I play a game that how can the
                characters move or fight, or how the websites were so detailed.
                Then I started to find out what IT is. After doing some research
                about it, I have realized that this is actually a world of
                power, a world in which I can do anything I want. I have tried
                sometimes to make a website but that was when I was too young
                and didn’t have enough knowledge. RMIT is an international
                university, where I can gain exposure to new knowledge sooner
                than IT students in other national universities. Moreover, at
                RMIT, I will have opportunities to balance daily life and
                student life when all subjects are about our major. I can study,
                and participate in activities such as clubs, … During my study,
                I want to learn all about coding and a little bit of graphic
                design so that I can create games as I want. Games Developing is
                where ITers can feel free to create their own stories, their own
                characters, etc.

              <li>Phuong Anh</li>
              <p>
                My name is Nguyen Thi Phuong Anh and my student number is
                s3926553. I am Vietnamese, and I was born in Hanoi – capital
                city of Vietnam. At the present, I can communicate in two
                languages: Vietnamese, which is my native tongue, and English,
                which I have studied since I was five years old. I am now a
                freshman at RMIT University in Hanoi, majoring in Information
                Technology. In terms of my pastime, I am passionate about
                traveling and discovering new locations, cultures, and
                societies. Aside from that, I am a huge enthusiast of
                technological gear, which is why I am enrolled in RMIT's IT
                program. In more detail about IT life, I’m keen on finding out
                about new technical devices released and playing games. I kinda
                like tinkering with electrical devices like once I could easily
                set touch ID for my mom’s smartphone while I had never had
                experience with using this device before. Generally, that was
                the beginning of my interest in technology, then I started
                embarking on researching, learning some basic Python code at the
                age of 14, watching related YouTube videos and practicing
                exercises by myself. A little bit growing up, I was more
                involved in the gaming industry. After experiencing almost all
                types of game, especially the adventure genre and watching games
                streaming, I realized that the game world was pretty interesting
                and I was motivated to also be able to create such an attractive
                video game in the future. Therefore, I gradually oriented myself
                to become a game developer.

              <li>Nguyen Dinh Khai</li>
              <p>
                I’m Nguyen Dinh Khai and my student number is s3925921. I was
                born and raised in Hanoi city in Vietnam. People might say I
                have a wide range of hobbies such as music, movies and clothing
                or just fashion in general. I often found myself researching old
                collections of various fashion houses/brands or just surfing
                through countless categories of clothes from vintage stores or
                second-hand clothing boutiques. Aside from that, I consider
                myself to be a big cinephile, I often spend time finding little
                known movies, lurking around forums, websites to learn more
                about art house movies from around the world and I am also
                keeping track of different movies festivals. I have always been
                fascinated about the technology world and wondering how an
                application works since I was kid. Recent years, I discovered
                the coding side of the industry and have treated it as an art
                form rather than a science subject. I guess that has sparked my
                interest in IT and I decided to join RMIT university to equip
                myself with fundamental knowledge about programming languages,
                data structures, algorithms, etc, to be a software engineer.
                Right now I'm in my first semester at RMIT and have learned
                about Python with a little of front-end web programming with
                HTML and CSS and I’m hoping to extend my computing knowledge
                during my time at RMIT.

                The results of 3 tests give me more information about my
                personality, strength and weaknesses in my life, at work,
                learning style that I should apply when I learn in order to have
                the best efficiency, my creative ability to apply for my work,
                even people who I’m suitable to work with. Based on these
                results, I would develop my strengths, improve my weaknesses,
                learn more skills that executives should have, and find the
                suitable partners and colleges to work with in the future. I do
                not think these results would affect my behavior when working as
                a team. These results are good advice for me to figure out my
                strengths to develop, my weaknesses as a member of a team, and
                it helps me to know what I should do in a team, and the role I
                should to improve my contribution and productivity as a team
                member for the best outcome. Based on these results, besides
                ability and knowledge when finding a team member, their
                personality, their learning style, strength and weaknesses are
                also another factor that affect my choice when forming a team. I
                would rather choose teammates who had strengths in my weaknesses
                in some aspects, enthusiastic and dedicated, besides, I also
                want to dedicate my strengths - what I am good at and always
                willing to do, not only helping my teammates to learn more
                knowledge, but also improve my knowledges when helping others
                with my own ability. Indeed, this test helped me a lot in
                forming a team.
              </p>
              <li>Tran Anh Son</li>
              <p>
                After completing all three tests, I think they give me more
                insights of my strengths and weaknesses in various real-life
                situations. I look to them as a solution to develop myself even
                more, sharpen what I am strong of and get rid as much as
                possible of my weakness. Also, these tests show me what I lack;
                therefore, I still have a lot to learn. However, I do not
                believe that those results will have any noticeable effect on my
                daily behavior and interactions with the people around me, as it
                is no easy task to change someone in just one day. I will take
                the results into consideration when I form a team later to
                complete future assignments or projects. That said, I should
                find people who bear similar characteristic traits to me so
                together we can improve ourselves further.
              </p>
              <li>Tran Duy Hung</li>
              <p>
                The three tests, as well as all of the others I've done, have
                accurately mirrored my personality, way of life, work style, and
                strengths and shortcomings. Only then can I promote my talents
                while minimizing my deficiencies to the greatest extent
                possible. Furthermore, these tests will have no effect on me or
                people around me, but they will reveal my limitations, allowing
                me to locate allies. For projects, this is the ideal option. I
                also hope that when working in groups, my skills will be put to
                the best possible use in order to assist everyone in the group.
                When I'm working in a group, I always know exactly what I need
                to do, and the other team members do as well. We always applaud
                initiative and assist one another in climbing together, but it
                also requires self-discipline on the part of each individual so
                that no one falls behind.
              </p>
              <li>Phuong Anh</li>
              <p>
                After the results were revealed, all three tests helped me
                uncover secret abilities and features about myself that I had
                never noticed or cared about before. With these results, I have
                learned what are my strong points and my weak points to find
                suitable teammates to work with for the upcoming projects at
                school and also for future work cooperation. Putting it into
                practice, I will improve my weaknesses as much as I can; or I
                can team up with someone who is superior to me in those
                weaknesses who can help me improve and learn to become a better
                version of myself and vice versa. I think these findings do not
                appear to have an impact on my teamwork behavior; however,
                thanks to these smart electronic mentors, I have been given
                useful advice to perform more professionally in both study and
                workplace environments. It can be said that the results have
                assisted me to understand more about myself so that I can look
                at them to develop and improve these hidden skills in the best
                way.
              </p>
              <li>Nguyen Dinh Khai</li>
              <p>
                The results give me an insight into my personality traits, allow
                me to realize my strengths and weaknesses, how and where my
                skills should be used and potentially inform me about many
                aspects through my nature shown on these tests. Furthermore, the
                results can also help me find other people with the same traits
                and wits. Although you should only take this with a grain of
                salt, the tests were still entertaining to a certain degree.
                Some of the results were not really plausible but it is still
                good for me to look at the overall image of myself portrayed on
                these tests. I can see myself resembling some of the results
                that were given such as independence and rationality. In a team,
                I would always try my best to finish my part of the assignment
                as fast as possible but still be able to ensure quality of the
                work. I would call myself a high achiever, always aim for high
                ratings and perform well on the tests, with that, my teammates
                could count on me when it comes to motivation to give their best
                as they could on whatever issues they encounter. When forming a
                team, these results could be a great medium to find and team up
                with someone who can make up for my weaknesses, for example,
                someone with expertise on the field that I am not familiar with
                or have no basic understanding. I would also like to work with
                people with equal or higher levels of understanding and mastery
                (in my field) so I can learn and improve myself.

            <li>Ideal jobs</li>
            <p>
              With five members, this is perhaps the largest group, but it does
              not mean that each person's task is light. We took the time to
              learn about each other's strengths and ideal job in order to be
              able to operate together. The ideal job has the same criteria and
              attributes for all five members. A bachelor's degree in
              information technology, electronic engineering, or similar fields
              is required for all employment, as well as a broad range of
              knowledge and proficiency in popular programming languages:
              Python, C++, Javascript,... and more programming languages come to
              mind. And English skills are also required for any IT jobs. In
              addition to similarity, due to the difference in career
              orientations, each member has a unique requirement of each
              position. In more details, Huy and Khai decide to have a foothold
              in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning,
              whereas Son, Hung and Phuong Anh are more into having positions in
              the game industry. Along with the differences in proficiency, Huy
              and Khai need additional artificial intelligence skills for their
              dream job, although Hung, Son, and Phuong Anh are required to have
              game programming experience. Generally, except for the necessity
              of Japanese language abilities from Khai’s employment, there does
              not appear a significant distinction between Huy’s and Khai’s jobs
              according to AI occupations. Meanwhile, on the gaming field, both
              Son and Hung are inclined to work with customers while Phuong Anh
              is required to spend more time sitting in front of the screen. To
              reach the jobs successfully, each member in the team has made a
              plan for the individual's development. As a result, according to
              the plan strategy, we are always up to date with the latest
              advances in world technology, as well as the drive to complete the
              program at RMIT. In the process, we will learn and hone the
              necessary information for future orientation, cultivate knowledge
              about programming and abilities related to the position of the
              jobs. Moreover, we also increase our English communication and
              expand our abilities to learn other languages so we can work more
              readily with international partners and have a more professional
              working style, despite the fact that the orientation is different.

            DevOps is the combination of development and operation. It focuses
            on a collaboration between developers and many other roles in order
            to improve productivity by automating repetitive tasks, designing
            and improving the IT infrastructure and continuously measuring
            application performance. A DevOps engineer has to have a significant
            amount of knowledge to be able to implement different softwares and
            technologies to shorten the system development process. He or she is
            the important key in combining codes, maintenance and management,
            works as a ‘middle man’ among the IT department, and provides better
            communication and collaboration and develops an agile relationship
            between development and operations teams . A DevOps engineer has to
            monitor and report the process of creating and pushing the product
            to the users and also will be scheduling and running meetings for
            the review and release of the product. In some organizations, the
            DevOps engineers take the place of a project manager as they are the
            one decide what to do in an IT project, make sure everyone is aware
            of the deadlines and resolve any problems. In some cases, one could
            refer to a DevOps engineer as a ‘know it all’ guy.
          </p>
          <p>
            A DevOps engineer needs to be communicative since he/she has to work
            with many people to connect different teams of the IT department.
            The project manager usually works with the DevOps team to layout the
            to-do-list for the day and discusses the work progress. Usually,
            DevOps engineers will meet with developers and QA (Quality
            Assurance) to have a discussion on what needs to be done and how it
            needs to be done and talk to the developers to make sure that they
            are able to write the code elegantly and efficiently. After the
            coding stage, they will work with the Tester to make sure the
            application has no errors and then provide support for the
            production servers to track if the app runs smoothly or not. A
            DevOps professional also sometimes helps in cultivating positive
            relationships with the businesses and the customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            DevOps pros spend most of their day going to different sectors of
            the IT department to help out with the problems or during these
            times, they often on online platforms such as Microsoft Teams or
            Zoom to communicate with the team about the production and release
            of the product. They don’t necessarily have to learn programming to
            the extent of a software engineer but they still need to have coding
            knowledge to clean up code, automate processes and discuss with the
            software development team. During the day, a DevOps engineer
            troubleshooting issues or testing out the code of the developers. In
            addition to that, he/she also has to plan and strategize for the
            future innovations of the technologies currently used and on a phone
            to talk with clients about their experience with the applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of challenges when it comes to DevOps as this is
            still quite a new concept, most notably is the resistance to change.
            The adoption of DevOps method can be intimidating and the complex of
            transitioning to this ten to put a lot of people off. Adapting to
            the DevOps work environment can take a long time but it should be
            smooth and gradual. First, you should find a small product to build
            and improve from there, when the team can see the benefits of
            implementing this method, they will start to want to adopt this new
            way of working. Another thing that DevOps engineers should take into
            account is that this work will require you to handle a lot of tools
            such as Jenkins, Docker, etc. This would make it difficult for the
            engineers to decide which is the reasonable tool to use in a certain
            situation. The lack of knowledge regarding tools can also drive down
            productivity as in this field, the technologies change with a high
            rate.

          <li>Software Engineer</li>
          <p>
            Software engineers, or sometimes called Software developers, are
            those who create applications for computers or other mobile devices.
            In other words, it is a computer science’s branch which consists of
            developing computer systems and applications software. Software
            developers are often required to have a deep understanding and
            extensive knowledge of some of the most used programming languages,
            as well as the development of software and computer operating
            systems. Additionally, they need to know about engineering
            principles and how to apply these said principles to software
            creation in an effective manner. Being able to do that at each
            single stage of the development process, a software engineer is very
            capable of creating customized systems meeting their customer’s
            requests. Just like every civil engineer would want their
            construction to have a strong foundation, a software engineer will
            also begin a project with careful research of their clients’
            requirements and then start working through the development process
            systematically.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is undoubtedly that one must possess many skills to become a
            software engineer. Though it is highly unlikely that a software
            engineer would spend their days writing code, knowledge of coding
            and computer programming in general, preferably some common
            programming languages like C/C++ or Python, is still a must in order
            for them to work in conjunction with computer programmers. In fact,
            even someone with a computer science degree but without significant
            programming experience would hardly make a good software engineer.
            Furthermore, understanding of software testing and debugging is a
            core technical skill for a software engineer. Although new AI
            programs are able to perform these tasks, it is still costly and
            very time-consuming for the development process; therefore, becoming
            adept at testing and debugging is vital to a software engineer. Last
            but not least, communication skills are a requirement as it is not
            common for software engineers to work in isolation. In fact, what
            really distinguishes Software Engineer from other similar roles is
            high-level collaboration, leadership and team building, which all
            comes down to communication skills. That said, a software engineer
            must be able to communicate effectively, in both writing and oral,
            to any team or company stakeholders regardless of their technical
            background or knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Software developers can be divided into two groups: application
            engineers and system engineers. The first group typically create,
            design or adapt applications for businesses and organisations by
            analysing the end user’s needs. They will develop, install and
            maintain those programs or applications. Meanwhile, system engineers
            have to coordinate in creating and maintaining computer systems from
            small businesses to large corporations. They take each department of
            a company's requirements, then suggest technical solutions and set
            up any networks that are computer-related for the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are multiple challenges and difficulties that a software
            engineer might face and need to resolve. One of them is the fast
            advancement of technologies. New tech everyday is a blessing for the
            IT world in general, but they also put a lot of pressure on software
            developers to leverage those new technology trends in order to be
            highlighted in the market. Moreover, software projects are often
            targeted at developing and designing applications that can meet
            various requests from clients. Even the simplest program or
            application requires the software engineers to understand the most
            advanced business concepts and bring in the requested features to
            satisfy their clients. In addition, software engineers have time
            limitations on their projects. They sometimes have to work
            productively under very pressured environments and do their best to
            finish the ordered program or application within strict and scanty
            timelines. Furthermore, time constraints often have negative effects
            on development teams and lead to reduction in the final products
            down the line.
          </p>

          <li>Tester</li>
          <p>
            Firstly, it is essential to know what a software developer is.
            According to techopedia, “A software tester is an individual that
            tests software for bugs, errors, defects or any problem that can
            affect the performance of computer software or an application.
            Software testers are part of a software development team and perform
            functional and non-functional testing of software using manual and
            automated software testing techniques.”
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a lot of work that testers have to do during their work.
            The first job that a tester must do is testing. This is a software
            testers’ priority, when they receive software from the development
            team, including checking bugs, errors that affect the performance of
            a program, making it not work as the team expected. Their mission
            after figuring out the program did not work correctly is to track
            the origin of the bugs. One important part of testers’ work is
            coordination with testers. When testers identify errors, bugs or
            differences inside the software or program, illustrate bugs and ask
            developers to fix them. Developers and testers need to work with
            each other multiple times, figure out every error and bugs, make
            sure that the softwares and programs work as the expectation of the
            whole team to be ready for further development of the software. Not
            only developers, communication and coordination with other
            departments is another work that testers must do. It is obvious that
            bugs not only come from software development, but also from other
            aspects, such as graphics, which can heavily affect the performance
            of the software, which might not meet the expectation of the whole
            team. As a result, graphical errors needed to be fixed and it is the
            responsibility of testers’ to tell designers to fix those graphic
            issues, also for further development. For example, in game
            development, the motion of characters and scenery in a game can be
            an error even though developers have done it right, designers need
            to check their work again. How can testers work effectively when
            there are a number of bugs that can appear several times, with no
            sequence, and different bugs are unique, and they can not follow a
            few ways when testing? Testers need a plan and reporting to deal
            with bugs and work with other departments effectively. However,
            testers need to understand the elements, fundamental and the nature
            of the software that they are going to test in order to set up plans
            to test, for example, in a game, they need to test different
            interactions between characters, whether there are any errors that
            are occured in game, testing graphic to make sure the game work well
            as the requirement and demand of the team. Indeed, understanding of
            the software plays an important role for testers to set “methodology
            and mechanism plan” to test softwares effectively and avoid time
            wasting during their work. According to Recro, “Once testing is
            over, the test analyst submits a testing report highlighting the
            major findings during checking for bugs.” In order to complete their
            work, testers need to choose a testing tool. According to Recro,
            “Software testing tools are products that a software tester uses
            along different phases in checking software for bugs”. In fact,
            testers depend largely on tools in testing software to find bugs and
            errors. “A test analyst may use management tools to manage the
            scheduling, logging and reporting of testing to reduce the burden of
            manual testing”, according to Recro. In other words, software
            testing tools are used to conduct more automated tests and reduce
            manual testing to reduce testing time, allowing cutting-edge
            software to develop further that is bug free and ready to publish.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the facing problems of testers is lack of testing
            documentation. In fact, most developers coordinate and communicate
            with testers mostly through verbal communication. As a result, some
            bugs or errors would be left, forgotten and untested. This issue
            would lead to inefficient testing and time wasted, when testers need
            more time to test the software and multiple times. Hence, concrete
            documents will make the working process between testers and
            developers more smooth and efficient. Another hardship is that
            testers are not flexible in using testing tools in their testing
            process. According to Recro, “More often than not, software
            companies expect software testers to stick to the available tools
            and carry out testing in a specific sequence. This prevents testers
            from dealing with every application as an individual entity and
            amounts to frustration.” It can be clearly seen that multiplying
            bugs is another problem of testers. A software from developers would
            be a storage of bugs, that took time and effort of testers to figure
            out every single error and make sure that development team fixed
            them, which might make testers tired and exhausted, especially when
            there is a lack of testing tools. Therefore, the best way for
            testers to deal with multiply of bugs is “sit with the developers
            and understand the prototype of the software to anticipate bugs in
            advance”, according to Recro, and this would help a tester to
            approach bugs in a new way, in order to deal with bugs more
            efficiently.

          <li>Android Developer</li>
          <p>
            According to the JobHero site, "An Android Developer is a Software
            Developer who specializes in designing applications for the Android
            marketplace. The Android marketplace is the direct competitor to
            Apple's app store. This means most of an Android Developer's job
            revolves around creating the apps we use on our smartphones and
            tablets."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Android Developer is in charge of designing, developing,
            maintaining, and updating applications for the Android platform.
            Android Developers are increasingly developing applications that can
            connect to peripheral devices, in addition to programs that run on
            the Android operating system. For instance, smart wrist watches that
            track steps and monitor health. Android developer is a fascinating
            field to work in. He finds it fascinating to create items for other
            people to use. He feels he is assisting many people when they
            utilize his products for business, recreation, and enjoyment... and
            find them valuable. So, how exciting will an Android Developer day
            be ? Most of the time an Android Developers will focus on these
            works: Building and developing software and complex applications on
            the Android platform are the most basic tasks that an Android
            developer must complete. Work with others in the team to improve
            products and create new features. Working with APIs and external
            data sources. Errors in products should be identified and corrected.
            Receive comments and requests from clients, partners' technical
            teams, or supervisors, and complete assignments to meet those
            criteria. Improve programming efficiency by updating technology and
            applying it to goods. Complete all necessary tasks to ensure the
            application's optimal performance, quality, and responsiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the Android operating system, he should study the successful and
            unsuccessful apps. This aids him in getting a sense of the big
            picture and understanding the common blunders as well as the key to
            running a successful mobile app. Referring to the process of
            developing a software application also saves him a lot of time and
            work when it comes to conducting market research and evaluating
            users more precisely. Use foresight, intelligence, adaptability, and
            imagination to program successful and useful software, depending on
            the job role and product features. Furthermore, developing industry
            ties will enable him to learn a great deal, receive advice from
            professionals, and gain a more realistic perspective on the
            industry. Don't miss out on the chance to enlist their assistance in
            assessing the applications you've submitted and determining how to
            make them better. When it comes to getting Android apps to operate,
            developers can sometimes get trapped in a rut. As a result of this
            issue, he will quickly become bored and lose interest in his job. As
            a result, learning is critical for him to maintain his positive
            attitude, collaborate effectively, and achieve the greatest results
            possible. He can develop his coding skills, which will not only make
            it easier for him to work, but will also assist his application to
            be constantly improved, not outdated, and customer-friendly. His
            items are the most practical. Software applications are continuously
            in severe competition and looking for methods to persuade users of
            touch devices to use their software. Technology is growing at a
            breakneck pace, and program applications are continually looking for
            new ways to get consumers to use their software. It is the
            uniqueness and utility of his products that enable him to outperform
            his competition; improving himself means upgrading the product as
            well, in order to stay up with the changing times. There are around
            200 million game programs, 5 million web browsers for Android, and
            12 million custom Android Firmware on the Android operating system
            now. He has to compete with many opponents no matter what field he
            works in. Each application must not only be good but also fast; if
            he spots an opening and learns a new programming ability, he should
            get to work right away. He will lose consumers to his competitors if
            he works too slowly or does not update frequently enough.
            Prototyping mobile apps is a crucial skill for an Android developer
            because it helps him to swiftly implement ideas while saving time
            and effort. Learning new information is neither simple or
            straightforward; it takes time to become accustomed to and
            comprehend the theories and languages of Android development. We
            can't understand and practice everything every day, therefore he
            needs to describe it clearly and create a specific study plan,
            determined to complete it. What must be ensured is an attitude of
            learning and dedication. To ensure that he will continue to pursue
            this business, please conduct thorough research before beginning to
            study. Does he believe himself capable and suitable to withstand a
            large amount of information and is programming as difficult as it is
            ? Only then would he be able to master programming and excel in his
            studies.

          <li>IOS Developer</li>
          <p>
            iOS, one of the most popular operating systems for mobile devices,
            which is the product created and developed by Apple Inc. since 2007.
            Better yet, iOS is the platform which Apple developed only for two
            devices which are mobile phones, iPhone and another handheld device
            called iPod touch. Then, an iOS developer is understood as a person
            who is in charge of building and developing software and
            applications running on the iOS platform, using two programming
            languages which are Swift from Apple and objective-C to be
            compatible with iOS operating system. The job of an iOS developer
            requires creative thinking, responding to needs, capturing
            psychology and creating novelty for users on applications. Moreover,
            it is important for him/her to have a thorough grasp of the iOS
            platform’s patterns and best practices related to the iOS field . In
            addition to proficiency in programming languages, iOS developers
            have to have spatial reasoning skills, which means they need to have
            a good imagination of the thing in 3D and understand the user
            experience to develop the applications efficiently. It can be said
            that iOS developers are key creative engineers who bring numerous
            software and applications to serve the needs of iOS customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            An iOS developer needs to have basic communication skills to
            communicate with customers and receive requests from them. After
            receiving the information, he or she will discuss and analyze with
            other iOS developers together to think of the idea, provide
            solutions and estimate the appropriate time to report back to
            customers. At the same time, customers will be offered some
            interface designs to choose, then the team will start conducting as
            per customer's demands by dividing the work for each member. After
            completing the features, iOS developers will write a comprehensive
            document of the application's features, installation, and simple
            flow then send it to the customers. Therefore, the job of an iOS
            developer needs to interact with both other developers and the
            client. Besides working with people, iOS developers especially
            require a lot of familiarity with Apple devices to assure the
            difference with Android or other operating systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally, iOS developers spend most of their time sitting in front
            of the screen and coding, maybe at home to have a quiet working
            space or at the workplace with other developers in the team to
            discuss and test the system together. Besides programming, they also
            have to work and talk with clients about products in professional
            workplaces such as companies or outside working places like a coffee
            shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several challenges that iOS developers have to face during
            their work. It may be claimed that iOS developers have to work a lot
            depending on consumer needs, thus they will occasionally have to
            deal with negative comments from users, such as not being correct or
            wishing to modify the application’s features. This means that they
            need to have good pressure tolerance and spend a lot of time
            re-testing the product over and over again to get the best results
            that please the customers. Another difficulty that comes to iOS
            developers is compatibility of the device. Each year, Apple releases
            new devices with both hardware and software having received
            significant improvements, thus, developers must continually update
            information about new features in new devices to develop the apps
            which will work on the most recent devices.

          <li>Cyber Security</li>
          <p>
            Nowadays people can virtually send and receive any sort of digital
            data by just a click of a button, but did they ever think how
            securely the data is being transferred or sent to other people
            without any breach of security ? To answer that, we must turn to
            cyber security. Privacy and security of data has always been a top
            problem that large corporations need to direct their attention to,
            especially in a world where almost any information can be stored
            online in a cyber and non-physical form. Let us take social
            networking for example. People all know that social platforms like
            Facebook or Twitter are now capable of providing millions of their
            users with tons of convenient features such as chatting with other
            people online or shopping online, but are those platforms secure
            when it comes to sensitive personal information ? Another instance
            is making transactions online. Today, more than 60 percent of
            transactions are done online, and that does not include other online
            shopping platforms not partnered with PayPal. It is clear that this
            field - Information Technology - requires a high quality of security
            to protect people from cyber attacks or hackers, hence cyber
            security has become the latest issue. Even some of the latest
            technological innovations like cloud computing, mobile computing or
            artificial intelligence demand a high level of security. Moreover,
            strengthening cyber security and protecting critical information
            infrastructures are essential to every country’s security and its
            wellbeing. As a matter of fact, many nations are imposing strict
            laws on cyber securities in order to prevent the loss of important
            information. Furthermore, cyber security’s scope is not just limited
            to securing information and data in the IT industry but also to
            various other fields such as cyber space. As of now, there are some
            trends which have a huge impact on cyber security. Cloud computing
            and its services are being slowly adopted by both small business and
            large companies, or in other words the world is moving towards the
            so-called “clouds”. This latest technology is presenting a big
            challenge for the field of cyber security as data or information can
            go around traditional points of inspection. Besides, due to the fact
            that the number of available services on the clouds is increasing at
            a high speed, policy controls for those services will have to evolve
            to prevent the loss of valuable data, hence the rising issues about
            their security. Cloud might provide immense opportunities for
            organizations and offer its user a great deal of convenience, it is
            still worth noting that as cloud computing continues to evolve so
            does the rise of its security concerns. The next technology that is
            affecting cyber security is mobile networks. Today we can connect to
            anyone in any part of the world using this technology, but they
            bring up a big concern on cyber security. In addition, firewalls or
            other security measures are becoming increasingly popular as people
            are using more and more personal mobile devices, all of which
            require extra protection on the Internet. We must always think about
            the security of these mobile networks, otherwise they will be highly
            prone to cyber crimes. Now let us have a look at some cyber security
            techniques. The concept of username and password is likely the first
            thing to come to mind when it comes to cyber security. This method
            has been the most fundamental way of protecting information,
            regardless of security system. Moving to a more advanced method, we
            have firewalls, which are computer programs, sometimes pieces of
            hardware, that help screen out hackers, viruses, worms and many
            other threats that are trying to breach into a computer system. All
            connections to the Internet, either from internal or external
            sources, must pass through the firewall present, which will examine
            each connection and block those that do not meet the specified
            security criteria. Thus firewalls have an important role in
            protecting computer systems on the Internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            The importance of cyber security is on the rise, that is no doubt.
            Basically, the world we are living in right now is more
            technologically reliant and dependent than ever before and this
            trend does not seem to slow down anytime soon. Data breaches that
            may very well be the cause of identity theft are now posted publicly
            on many social platforms, and personal information such as credit
            card numbers, bank account or national ID card numbers are now
            stored by many people in cloud services, namely Google Drive or
            OneDrive. The point here is that it does not matter who you are,
            either an individual, small business or even large multinational
            company, you have to take advantage of computer systems every now
            and then. Pair this fact with the increasing number of cloud
            services, smart mobile devices and the IoT (Internet of Things) and
            we have tons of potential security vulnerabilities that did not even
            exist just a few years ago. Therefore, governments around the world
            are forced to bring their attention to cyber crimes. The General
            Data Protection Regulation (or GDPR in short) is a great example of
            this trend. Through its regulations, it has increased the
            reputational damage of data branches by forcing all organisations
            that want to operate in the EU to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Communicate data breaches.</li>
            <li>Appoint a data protection officer.</li>
            <li>Require user consent to process information.</li>
            <li>Anonymise data for better privacy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The scope of this trend towards public disclosure is not just
            limited to Euro. While there are not yet any national laws on data
            breach disclosure in the US, there are already laws in terms of data
            breach in all 50 states, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Required to notify those affect as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>Let the government know as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>Pay a fine if need to.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            According to Wikipedia, the California data security breach
            notification law was enacted in 2002 and became effective on July 1,
            2003, forcing persons or businesses to notify those affected
            “without reasonable delay” and “immediately following discovery”. By
            this regulation, victims can sue up to 750 US dollars and
            corporations or companies can be fined up to ten times that amount
            of money per victim. As a result, this has driven many law enforcing
            agents to release frameworks to help organisations understand their
            security risks, improve cyber security measures as well as prevent
            potential cyber attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a normal person, I might not fully grasp the importance of cyber
            security but I still take advantage of it in some ways. Without any
            type of protection on the Internet, my sensitive information could
            have been hacked or stolen whenever I post a status on social
            platforms like Facebook or Twitter, or whenever I use my credit card
            to pay for items I buy online. In addition to that, cyber security
            is beneficial to my mental health since it provides me with a sense
            of security when I am online. One could even say that cyber security
            has always had an important role in my life even though I have just
            learnt about it in detail recently. With the advancement of
            technology, I find myself using more methods of protecting my
            information than ever, which consists of face recognition and
            fingerprint authorisation. Thanks to those new technologies in this
            field, I no longer have to memorise lengthy passwords for each
            website I often visit while still making everything faster and more
            secure.
          </p>

          <li>Chatbots</li>
          <p>
            A chatbot, sometimes known as a chatterbot, is a computer program
            using AI software that conducts online chat conversations using text
            or text-to-speech instead of a real human agent. Visitors can
            interact with chatbots in two different ways, through apps that are
            either web-based or stand-alone. They are also called digital
            assistants due to the capability of comprehending human abilities,
            combining with the capacity to reply rapidly to users. The most
            crucial duty of a chatbot is to analyze and recognize user request
            intent in order to extract relevant elements. After the analysis is
            completed, the user will receive the appropriate response. The
            chatterbots process by using four classification methods, which are
            natural language understanding (NLU), pattern matching, backgrounds
            and expectations. The chatbot industry is classified into 2
            categories: the first one is rule-based chatbots that follow
            predefined paths in pre-programmed conversations, while the second
            one is AI chatbots, which are higher level than rule-based chatbots
            and be able to interact with users like the way that humans converse
            and communicate in real-life situations. The tendency of using
            chatbots is increasing gradually and they have been applied widely
            in many fields of human daily life. People can apply chatbots in
            business, marketing, education, hospitality and more. One of the
            most innovative chatbots lately is Hey Siri, which is a product from
            Apple Inc. Hey Siri, or Siri is a type of AI chatbot, which is a
            virtual assistant using voice commands to answer questions and
            respond to requests from users. Released in 2011 with iPhone 4s,
            Siri became the hottest topic in the chatbot industry in particular
            and AI in general at that time, appearing on all Apple platforms,
            namely iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS. With Siri, users can be
            supported in different ways, such as announcing notifications,
            reminding, finding information needed on the Internet, alarming or
            even having a small conversation with it during free-time. With the
            explosion of AI development, chatbots are ”invading” the internet
            like a storm. They have evolved to become more intelligent and
            “human” year by year, no longer boring and emotionless responses.
            According to Markets Insider, “The chatbot market size is projected
            to grow from USD 2.6 billion in 2019 to USD 9.4 billion by 2024, at
            a CAGR of 29.7% during the forecast period.” It can be seen that the
            chatbot business is growing and gaining more attention as people
            recognize it and no longer see it as an impediment while conversing
            with a robot. Looking at this positive point, 80% of businesses are
            promoted to apply chatbots into their services, allowing them to
            perform a variety of more advanced tasks, helping to increase
            customer experience in the technology era. Putting it into practice,
            chatbot can literally replace human in the field of sales in the
            future by programming it to be able to answer basic questions from
            customers such as “ Is there any this product left?”, “How does this
            product cost?”,… then it will send the final order forms to the
            salesclerks. Otherwise, if there is any difficult question that the
            chatbot cannot process; for example: bargaining, they can simply
            say: “ Let me ask my owner, please wait for a second.”, then the
            owner will appear and only have to handle difficult situations that
            will not need to receive basic questions all the time. Many
            enterprises have applied this technology to their automatic sale
            services, typically eBay and Staples. As a result, not only have
            they received many positive comments from users, but also the
            company’s operational apparatus has improved with more productivity.
            Generally, chatbots are being popular all over the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            ​​It can be said that chatbots have a great influence on people’s
            lives. Thanks to the development of AI chatbots, they can help
            people take care of more customers than usual. Humans are able to do
            many things, but their ability to accomplish several tasks at once
            is limited with the mistakes that they might encounter often. By
            contrast, AI chatbots are built to manage hundreds of client chats
            at once without making any mistakes. They answer the customers
            immediately, no matter what time it is and how many contacts there
            are. They can also help people capture leads and protect the
            business from losing those valuable customers. Following the
            positive aspect, with chatbots, people can save operating costs.
            They really save a lot of money as people do not have to keep hiring
            new people to handle the customer service part. Although chatbots
            are a big investment at the beginning, in the long term, it will
            really save a lot of money. All the salesclerks need to do is
            integrate AI chatbots-based customer care service into the business.
            This will help take in customer queries and resolve them quickly and
            efficiently. Besides the potentialities, the growth of these
            utilities has come with the possibility of losing jobs in many
            fields. Like any new technology, chatbots will eventually replace
            humans in certain jobs, whereby jobs will also be lost. However, it
            is a testament to technological progress, and we cannot avoid it.
            According to the Open Access Government, it is shown that one of the
            jobs which will be possible to be replaced by chatbots in the future
            is Telemarketer and Customer Care; there is a 99% chance that this
            job role will be replaced by AI chatbots. The advent of artificial
            intelligence has further enhanced the performance of these bots and
            it can now learn previously answered queries to become smarter like
            humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my everyday life, thanks to the advance of chatbots, my life has
            been improved to be more convenient. Hey Siri is a notable example,
            instead of looking for the internet browser and typing the
            information needed, now I can just simply call “Hey, Siri! What is
            the best spaghetti recipe?” and it will send me the best link
            directly. Or maybe if there is a call when I am doing the washing
            up, I can say “Hey, Siri! Accept the call.”, then I can talk to the
            caller without having to stop my work and pick the phone up. Another
            example of chatbot having an impact on my life is a math helper
            application called “Mathway”. Utilizing this website, I can ask for
            the difficult math problems at any time and receive the solution
            directly from the AI without having to find a tutor and wait for
            them to respond. As a result, chatbots literally help me save both
            time and money combined with greater productivity and efficiency
            thanks to the artificial intelligence and non-stop working machines.
            About my friends, one of them is a shop owner of an online bakery
            and she also has applied chatbot in her business. By being supported
            by chatbot to answer the client requests via online message, her
            work has improved markedly. In the past, she had to receive orders
            and bake cakes at the same time, thus sometimes the orders could not
            be delivered on time. But for now, with the chatbot, she has been
            relieved of her daily work burden and has more time to focus only on
            baking. Thanks to chatbots, my life and the people around me have
            become more convenient than ever. Chatbots have a bright future
            ahead of them. I hope that in the future, chatbots will be further
            developed and enhanced to increase human life efficiency.

          <li>AI and Machine Learning</li>
          <p>
            Nowadays AI and machine learning is becoming a buzzword in the
            technology world, and both AI and machine learning is considered to
            be a breakthrough of the IT industry, when AI and machine learning
            can be a revolution for the development of the society. So, what is
            artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning ? About the
            definition of AI, according to IBM,“ AI is the science and
            engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent
            computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using
            computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to
            confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.”[1]
            Regarding machine learning, according to IBM, “Machine learning is a
            branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer science which
            focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that
            humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.” This is some of the
            most innovative technologies in the modern day, where it can be
            considered to change the world in different aspects. One of the most
            questions that people would ask about these technologies is what is
            the state of art of these technologies? However, firstly, what is
            the state of art ? To simply understand, the state of art of a
            technology is the most modern outcome of a technology. AI and
            machine learning are both innovative outcomes of the Information
            technology industry, as a result, application of AI and machine
            learning can be applied in different aspects of our life, such as
            business, healthcare, robotics, security, automation and other
            applications of these technologies. Regarding business, one of the
            most beneficial aspects of business is marketing. In general, AI and
            machine learning can improve the productivity and efficiency of
            different marketing work, such as email marketing, social media
            marketing, market research and other marketing activity. For
            example, Facebook is one of the most famous corporations in using AI
            and machine learning in advertising. Firstly, facebook will analyze
            users’ interest in social media, based on likes, shares or comments
            of users on their newsfeed. Besides, a searching engine would be
            another source for Facebook advertisements. Facebooks’ machine
            learning will create algorithms on its own to show the advertisement
            that they suppose that users would care about and ensure the quality
            of advertisements based on users’ review and feedback. Another
            aspect that many people care about AI and machine learning is
            automatic robots that would replace humans in dangerous jobs.
            According to elite data science, one of the most dangerous jobs is
            welding, which “produce noise, intense heat and toxic substances
            found in the fumes ”now can be replaced by robots, however, without
            machine learning, these robots can only weld in certain locations
            that have been pre-programmed. However, thanks to machine learning
            advancement, flexibility and accuracy of these robots have been
            improved significantly. When it comes to healthcare, according to
            Mark Michalski, executive director, Massachusetts General Hospital
            "2018 will be the year AI becomes real for medicine. ... In 2018,
            we'll begin the adoption of a technology that may truly transform
            the way providers work, and the way patients experience healthcare,
            on a global scale." Thanks to the development of computer power, AI
            and machine learning are becoming powerful supporters for healthcare
            professionals to work with patients faster and more accurately,
            innovative treatments and reduce healthcare costs. In the future, in
            my opinion, one of the most important breakthroughs of AI and
            machine learning is the widespread use of emotional intelligence. In
            fact, nowadays, Hanson robotic company has invented a humanoid robot
            called Sophia, which can answer different questions in different
            aspects, has its own knowledge and the most noticeable feature: its
            own emotion. In the future, thanks to the development of modern
            technology and increase in demand for AI and machine learning,
            emotional intelligence of AI and machine learning would be one of
            the most noticeable achievements of Information technology in the
            near future.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI and machine learning have different impacts on many aspects of
            society. Thanks to AI and machine learning, “socially therapeutic
            robots have been created to help senior citizens or people with
            physical challenges to overcome their difficulties, especially
            loneliness, reduce anxiety, increase social reaction”, according to
            PMC. One of the most important impact of AI and machine learning in
            business is digital marketing, thanks to AI and machine learning
            algorithms, companies can base on AI to identify and find the
            potential customers for their company, as a result, buy and sell
            rates of the market would be increase and contribute to the
            development of a country. However, one of the most important impacts
            of AI and machine learning is the reduction in errors related to
            human fatigue. In fact, a number of jobs that are dangerous,
            repetitive and monotonous such as mining, welding, construction,...
            Moreover, when workers become exhausted and fatigued, the higher
            risk the work would become, as a result, more errors would be
            occured and decrease the work productivity and the quality of the
            outcome. Fortunately, AI and other robotic applications would never
            suffer fatigueness, so the quality and work progress would be
            ensured, even faster and AI can accomplish work more accurately.
            Regarding positive impact, the most beneficial people would be
            business owners, technology developers, even ordinary people, where
            the application of AI and machine learning would improve work
            productivity and save the labor cost of a company. In contrast,
            manual workers would have lost their job because of the accuracy and
            adaptiveness of AI and machine learning, which in the future, would
            potentially replace humans in those jobs. Not only hand-operated
            jobs, because of autonomation of AI and machine learning, taxi
            drivers would be replaced by self-driving cars, travel agents would
            be replaced by virtual assistants such as Siri, where people can ask
            it to book a flight ticket, cashiers would be replaced by modern
            paying system, for example in Amazon’s supermarket, users only need
            to enter the supermarket, choose what they need and leave, while the
            payment would work later, with no staffs inside the department.
            Indeed, there are a number of impacts that artificial intelligence
            can have on us and there are a number of old jobs that could be
            replaced.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my daily life, there are many applications of AI and machine
            learning that are beneficial for my life. Facebook advertisement is
            an example, where it helps me to be able to approach more product
            choices from different sources, with different price ranges and
            variables. It helps me to save time for product choice instead of
            spending more time researching different products. Another
            application of AI and machine learning that I use often is virtual
            assistant, in detail, Google assistant. For me, it helps my life to
            become more convenient in some way. For example, the simple task
            that I can ask Google to do is setting an alarm for me, playing
            music or quickly researching for information. One of the best parts
            that I love about Google is music suggestions, based on the music
            that Google often plays for me and the songs that I choose. However,
            I do not have much opportunity to approach some of the state of art
            of AI and machine learning, so my life did not have too much of a
            difference, and so do my families and friends. However, in the
            future, thanks to the development of modern technology, I hope the
            lives of people would change significantly, so my family, friends
            and I would have the opportunity to approach with what I expect. For
            example, IOT connected to AI and deep learning to learn users’
            behavior, habit and schedule would help my family’s life become more
            convenient, healthcare AI and deep learning would be efficiency, as
            a result, disease would be cured in the most effective way that save
            times and money, based on innovative treatment and analysis.
            However, in the future, a number of people who are not sensible and
            updated with the cutting edge technology would be backward with this
            new technology, especially when it is evolving rapidly, and as I
            mentioned, some of them would lose their job or their life would be
            negatively impacted by AI and machine learning and left behind. This
            is inevitable for a small part of the society, as the drawbacks of
            these modern technologies.

          <li>Cloud Computing</li>
          <p>
            Cloud computing is the delivery of computer resources to users
            through the Internet based on their intended usage. Any resource
            connected to computing and computing, such as software, hardware,
            network infrastructure, servers, and vast networks of servers, can
            be used. Before cloud computing, if you wanted to do something, you
            had to do it yourself and invest your own money nearly from start to
            finish. You must purchase a hard disk as an individual user if you
            want to save data. Do you want to back up your data on a regular
            basis and in real time? Aside from the hard disk, you'll need to
            locate the program and, if desired, connect it to the network. You
            must purchase a server, assemble, and configure everything yourself
            if you want to create a website. If you want to keep track of your
            home store's sales, you'll need to purchase accounting or sales
            software and install it on your computer. And it doesn't end when
            you pay for something. After that, the money you spend will be
            followed by so-called "maintenance". When you acquire a hard drive,
            you must return it for warranty service if it breaks. Unfortunately,
            once the warranty time has expired, you will lose all of your data
            and have to spend more money to replace the drive. You install the
            server, then you have to maintain it yourself, take care of the
            cooling system, and take care of your own backups (or get someone
            else to do it for you, it's the same thing; you just have to pay
            someone to do it for you. stop). You install accounting software,
            then have to reinstall it on your computer every time it is updated,
            and if there is an issue, you have to correct it yourself (or call
            the company to ask how to fix it). These issues appear simple at
            first glance, but they cost you a lot of time and money, not to
            mention making you more vulnerable to data loss (as in the hard
            drive example above). Then came cloud computing, which helped to
            solve the problem of having to manage your own hardware and software
            to some extent. Do you require data storage? You can store your
            files on OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Obviously, it makes no
            difference which HDD your file is stored on, whether it's damaged or
            not, whether you need to backup to a secondary HDD or not, or where
            it's stored. You also don't have to worry about connecting two
            machines to receive files from two different locations. The cloud
            service provider, in this case Dropbox, Google, or Microsoft, has
            already "taken care" of everything. The ability of cloud computing
            is undeniable, as it allows users to easily access data via the
            internet. There are numerous Cloud Computing applications that can
            be carried out:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Database in the cloud</li>
            <li>Website and application testing and development</li>
            <li>Analysis and management of big data</li>
            <li>Data from your website is stored on a cloud server.</li>
            <li>
              Data can be easily shared using platforms like Google Drive,
              Dropbox, and Shutterstock...
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Cloud computing, like other new technology, has its own set of
            terminology and acronyms. IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are three key terms
            that are fortunately straightforward and easy to comprehend:
            Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a term that describes having
            access to computer network hardware. Many resources are available,
            such as firewalls, load balancers, and IP addresses, but you will be
            responsible for installing and updating the operating system and
            applications. This allows you to choose the resources you want to
            use more freely. Amazon, Memset, Google, Windows, and others have
            all offered IaaS.... Developing cloud service templates as a
            blueprint for establishing a ready-to-use system and avoiding
            migration between clouds is one technique to make IaaS management
            easier. Operating systems, databases, web servers, and programming
            execution environments are all provided by Platform as a Service
            (PaaS) to cloud computing users. It also enables you to concentrate
            on specific apps while letting cloud providers manage and measure
            resources automatically. As a result, PaaS enables you to spend less
            work on the operating system and more time on apps and end-to-end
            services. PaaS is a service provided by IaaS providers to assist you
            manage your workload. When you want to put the end user first,
            Software as a Service (SaaS) is the way to go. Allows you to use
            cloud-based apps without having to worry about the infrastructure or
            platform. This indicates that it is simple to use and scale. Email,
            office software, and auditing tools from Google, Microsoft,
            Freshbooks, and other SaaS providers are just a few examples. Other
            "as a service" options are also available. People frequently add "as
            a service" to cloud computing to identify it as a global network
            rather than a computer in the workplace when describing it. There
            are other variations from the three main types described above,
            including "Storage as a service" (STaaS), "Data as a service"
            (DaaS), and "Security as a service" (SECaaS).
          </p>
          <p>
            Cloud computing will undoubtedly undergo significant changes in the
            near future (the next few years), and by grasping these changes,
            this technology can evolve in the following ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hybrid-cloud: Hybrid cloud integrates public cloud services,
              private cloud services and on-premises infrastructure and provides
              orchestration, management and application portability across all
              three. The result is a single, unified and flexible distributed
              computing environment where an organization can run and scale its
              traditional or cloud-native workloads on the most appropriate
              computing model. Hybrid multi-cloud is a hybrid cloud that
              includes public cloud services from more than one cloud service
              provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              Distributed-cloud: is a public cloud computing service that lets
              you run public cloud infrastructure in multiple different
              locations - not only on your cloud provider's infrastructure but
              on premises, in other cloud providers’ data centers, or in
              third-party data centers or colocation centers - and manage
              everything from a single control plane. With this targeted,
              centrally managed distribution of public cloud services, your
              business can deploy and run applications or individual application
              components in a mix of cloud locations and environments that best
              meets your requirements for performance, regulatory compliance,
              and more. Distributed cloud resolves the operational and
              management inconsistencies that can occur in hybrid cloud or
              multi-cloud environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Multi-cloud: Multicloud is the use of cloud services from more
              than one cloud vendor. It can be as simple as using
              software-as-a-service (SaaS) from different cloud vendors – e.g.,
              Salesforce and Workday. But in the enterprise, multicloud
              typically refers to running enterprise applications on
              platform-as-a-service (PaaS) or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
              from multiple cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services
              (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure. A
              multicloud solution is a cloud computing solution that's portable
              across multiple cloud providers' cloud infrastructures. Multicloud
              solutions are typically built on open-source, cloud-native
              technologies, such as Kubernetes, that are supported by all public
              cloud providers. They also typically include capabilities for
              managing workloads across multiple clouds with a central console
              (or 'single pane of glass'). Many of the leading cloud providers,
              as well as cloud solution providers such as VMware, offer
              multi-cloud solutions for compute infrastructure, development,
              data warehousing, cloud storage, artificial intelligence (AI) and
              machine learning (ML), disaster recovery/business continuity and
              more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Edge computing: Edge computing is a distributed computing
              framework that brings enterprise applications closer to data
              sources such as IoT devices or local edge servers. This proximity
              to data at its source can deliver strong business benefits,
              including faster insights, improved response times and better
              bandwidth availability.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Cloud computing technology has now affected far too many aspects of
            life and has become an unavoidable need. When all information or
            data is stored on the cloud. When consumers can access any platform
            in any field from anywhere with only a few easy actions, this
            technology is becoming highly useful. This is true even for student
            learning, as many online courses, as well as video lectures and
            other resources required for the learning process, are available for
            free to anybody. And, in a circumstance like the Covid-19 pandemic,
            where the issue is exceedingly intricate, the use of cloud computing
            technology aids much in calculating and tracking patient data.
            Because of the numerous advantages that cloud computing provides, an
            increasing number of firms are opting for it. The following are some
            of the most important advantages of cloud computing for businesses:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Anywhere, Anytime Access: Bringing data to the cloud makes it
              simple for everyone in the organization to access it from anywhere
              at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
              The ability to adapt quickly: This is evident when businesses need
              to extend their storage; with only a few system operations, your
              storage will be enlarged without the need to purchase more
              storage. When compared to the prior conventional paradigm, any
              physical device.
            </li>
            <li>
              High security: A third party will monitor all actions in the cloud
              environment, as well as provide frequent updates and
              troubleshooting. As a result, the system is quite safe.
            </li>
            <li>
              Environmental protection: When opposed to using each hardware
              storage system individually, employing a single cloud system
              reduces energy generated while system operation, reducing the cage
              effect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Current trends are being updated: Cloud computing is now
              considered a modern trend. Cloud computing is increasingly being
              used for management applications by all firms, including small and
              medium-sized businesses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sustainable and stable cooperations: In the corporate context,
              when transmitting data across departments, the file information is
              frequently amended, resulting in the data being disturbed and no
              longer accurate. Because fixed data is saved in a single area on
              the cloud, it will be accurate and consistent regardless of who
              has access to it. This is quite useful for data management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cost-cutting: Cloud computing, according to analytical and
              comparative studies between cloud computing and traditional
              computing, would help organizations save around 30% on company
              activities such as maintaining and upgrading computer systems, and
              purchasing software copyrights.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I believe that cloud computing is a vital technology in people's
            life as someone who surfs the web and uses social networking
            platforms. Cloud computing is becoming increasingly beneficial and
            vital since everyone requires a location to store data and protect
            personal information. As someone who enjoys both music and movies,
            I'm always looking for new places to keep my items or share them
            with others who share my interests. Actually, I didn't know much
            about this technology until lately, when I was forced to work and
            learn on social media sites such as Youtube, Facebook, Instagram,
            and Canvas for homework. And, thanks to this helpful technology, my
            family finds it much easier to manage product information or orders
            when trading in products. All transaction information is maintained
            on the internet thanks to the simplicity of cloud computing, which
            eliminates the need to manually print or write down each receipt.
